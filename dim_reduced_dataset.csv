 comedy ," Two researchers have come to San Francisco to compete for a research grant in Music. One seems a bit distracted, and that was before he meets her. A strange woman seems to have devoted her life to confusing and embarassing him. At the same time a woman has her jewels stolen and a government whistle blower arrives with his stolen top secret papers. All, of course have the same style and color overnight bag. This is the comic tale of four identical pieces of red plaid luggage and one San Francisco hotel, in the spirit of Howard Hawks but made by Peter Bogdanovich. One bag contains secret government files, another has expensive jewels and a third has igneous rocks. It is unclear what is in the fourth bag, carried by the would-be erudite Judy Maxwell...but all four bags end up at the Hotel Bristol. Judy has a yen for food and Dr. Howard Bannister and no ""off"" button. Dr. Bannister (deliciously deadpan and hunky, Ryan O'Neal) has a yen for igneous rock formations. When all four bags are hopelessly mixed up and Eunice, Howard's prim and bossy fiance (unforgettably played by Madeline Kahn) is kidnapped, only the long arm of the law, (i.e. the judiciary), can make any sense of the chaos. There are no palaeontologists or tigers but there are madcap antics, the obligatory San Francisco chase scenes and several clever one-liners. Howard Bannister travels to San Fransisco with his fiancÃ© to compete for a musicology research grant, when he runs into a wild, unpredictable college drop out who brings ""havoc and chaos everywhere (she) goes.""

With his straight laced and controlling fiancÃ©e Eunice Burns, Howard is in San Francisco to attend the Congress of American Musicologists convention hosted by Frederick Larrabee. The Larrabee Foundation has shortlisted two finalists for the $20,000 Larrabee Grant, the two being pompous Hugh Simon and Howard, whose research involves prehistoric man making music with igneous rocks. Howard's life in San Francisco is turned upside down when he meets Judy Maxwell, a klutzy, directionless but brilliant young woman whose life is spent studying at one educational institution after another, her stint at each being until she's kicked out. It's love at first sight for Judy, who does whatever she can to insinuate herself into Howard's life. Further complications ensue as Howard, Judy, wealthy Mrs. Van Hoskins and reporter Mr. Smith - the latter two who are staying at the same hotel as Howard - all have the identical red plaid overnight bag respectively carrying Howard's igneous rocks, Judy's clothes, Mrs. Van Hoskins jewels and top secret government documents, the latter two which are eyed by others who are trying to get their hands on the contents."

A minor official, plagued by persecution mania, fears a dreadful end to the matter. Though the signs he sees of this are all wrong, nevertheless, in a furious finale, the outside world descends upon the house and his inhabitants."

Their quest is complicated by Fogell's falling in with two inept cops who both slow and assist the plan. If they do get the liquor to the party, what then? Is sex the only rite of passage at hand? Seth, Evan and Fogell are three teenage guys who love to drink and desperately wish to get laid. When a girl that Seth really likes, asks him to get the drink for her party, he sees this as a perfect opportunity to make her his girlfriend.

Seth and Evan become separated from Fogell (now called McLovin) and they still haven't got the alcohol for the party that night.

 documentary ," PIIGS is a documentary that challenges prevalent European budgetary policies and the austerity dogma.

Consequently, the whole European project has become in doubt. PIIGS is a Southern European take into austerity dogma and states with the voice of prestigious international economists, intellectuals and experts, that the origin of the European debt crisis is not the inadequacy of people in crisis countries but the very foundation of euro itself.

 documentary ," The town of Flint, Michigan, a miniscule point on the map, recently drew national attention through documentary film maker Michael Moore. Moore, a Flint native, wrote and directed the documentary Roger and Me about the darker side of capitalism and General Motors. Omar McGee, another Flint native, picks up where Moore left off with Flint Town Kids, a documentary showing the African American dark side of Flint. Flint is predominantly populated by African Americans who migrated from the south after Reconstruction. Flint can be viewed as a microcosm of America's poverty stricken urban areas. Once abandoned by General Motors, Flint became one of the poorest urban areas in the country. Flint Town Kids captures the bleak setting in which these Flint natives exist. It powerfully examines the hardships, the sufferings, mishaps and sacrifices made in order to persist in this town. Flint Town Kids highlights the frightening education system in Flint where schools are designed to produce basketball players only. On the other hand, students who are non basketball players are left with mediocre excuses for classrooms while adjusting to the lack of libraries needed to empower young minds. The documentary takes a very close look at children who bare the armor of strength in trying to escape Flint. Flint's has been successful in producing a legacy of basketball players ranging from playground hopefuls to the pros. The film highlights current and former NBA players such as Morris Peterson (Toronto Raptors), Eddie Robinson (Chicago Bulls), Trent Tucker and Glen Rice as well as Tracy McGrady (Houston Rockets) LeBron James, (Cleveland Caveliers), Jason Richardson (Golden State Warriors) Chucky Atkins (Boston Celtics) and Jonathan Bender (Indiana Pacers) who have achieved the dream of making it to the pros. For those who are not as fortunate to escape the nightmarish lifestyle that Flint brings, they embark on survival methods such as drugs and violence. Flint Town Kids brings to light the little faith left in the system. Children raising kids and kids age ten killing each other is just an everyday part of life in Flint. The documentary will depict those shocking scenes in the lives of children who are left with no choice but to make adult decisions in a world where only the fittest survive. For many adults the consuming goal of overcoming poverty lies in making cocaine. Flint Town Kids graphically explores this process which seems to have become the saving grace for many in a town that presents scarce positive outcomes for the future. Flint Town Kids will leave audiences outraged and enthralled with the African American lifestyle in an area that once presented promise only miles from the Motor City. Follow-up to Dollar Bill Y'All. Story revolves around the youth on the streets of Flint, Michigan and the choices they face. Several Flintown Kids grow up to be ballers, jumping right from high school to the NBA while others are faced to find other ways off the streets, like selling drugs and resorting to violence. This documentary takes us through their world."

Instead of traditional protesters, these guardians are ""protectors"" - they protect their lands and waters for future generations, by addressing both the ecological and the spiritual dimensions of land and water. This new framing of activism emerged into public consciousness at Standing Rock in North Dakota, at the same time we were filming these leaders articulating this powerful alternative way of seeking social and environmental justice. Through our footage at the IUCN World Conservation Congress we see that the conservation movement is awakening to the value and importance of indigenous leadership as we all seek a way out of global crisis. Balancing politics and spirituality is an essential element of this new way forward and indigenous guardians of sacred sites are grappling with these issues in a deep and fundamental way that offers new hope."

 documentary ," The larger scope of the story explores the gun trade to Africa that takes place under the covers -- Russian pilots fly guns into Africa, then fly fish back out to Europe. The hazards and consequences of this trade are explored, including the pan-African violence propagated by constant flow of weapons into the continent. If it is a ""survival of the fittest"" world, as Darwin concluded, then the capitalist interests that fund the gun runners are climbing the evolutionary ladder on the backs of the Africans in this stark Darwinian example. Much like the foreseeable extinction of the Lake Victoria perch, and death of Lake Victoria itself, the Africans are in grave jeopardy, even as they survive in the only ways they know how. In the 1950s or 1960s, the Nile perch was released into the Lake Victoria. In just a few decades, the large, voracious predator has all but eliminated the other species of fish, turning the lake into an ecological wasteland. ""But economically, it's good"" -- and indeed, perch fillet is Tanzania's best selling export to Europe. Fishermen, factory workers, civil servants, pilots of cargo aircrafts, delegates of the European Commission, communities living around Lake Victoria: plenty of people are involved in some way in this new industry. But if Africa exports hundreds of tons of premium-priced fish each day, what exactly do Africans get in return?"

 documentary ," A young female crocodile sets her sights on the strongest male, but he's intent on attracting the older females. Patiently she waits, watching his mating ritual make the waters dance. Against the odds, she mates with him, but her babies are vulnerable to the other crocodiles. Can they survive or did she bite off more than she can chew? Over 160m years, these Jurassic survivors have evolved into perfect predators. Equipped like deadly submarines, with specialized weapons of stealth and attack, the armoured crocodile has no equal. To the ancient Egyptians they were river gods. To the migrating wildebeest of the Serengeti they mean abrupt and unforeseen death. It takes a special kind of crocodile to thrive in the chill air of southern Africa's subtropical flood plains. Lavish cinematography and unique access make this far more than a regular croc-doc. The African landscape, family storylines, and the constant threat of danger, make for a remarkable adventure."
 documentary ," The film is a sequel of 'About Neshka Robeva And Her Girls'. An attempt to analyze the process of creation (generally) through the dance miniatures, created by the trainer and three of her competitors in modern and rhythmic gymnastics. The problems of creative compromise, of the 'scissors' between author's imagination and audience's desires, of the judges' criteria (no matter if they are called 'jury' or 'critics') are observed. The documentary depicts the process of creation of rhythm gymnastics trainer Neshka Robeva and her dance miniatures. The focus is on creating such a miniature from scratch - choosing the music, dance moves, choreographic concept. Alongside of this, the dancers also grow and build a character on stage. Some of them break under the pressure, despite their talent. Yet, new ones are to come and here we have Bianka Panova, a four-time world champion to be. Group choreography is another focus of the film. It's hard to convey the essence of artistic creation on the big screen, yet when the three girls Bianka, Lilly and Delyana are doing their winning miniatures we feel as if we are watching not sports but art happening before our eyes."

 documentary ," Twelve New Yorkers born in the early 1960s across several continents ""visit"" every year of their lives in a brash, self-reflexive experiment about what it's meant to live in America over the last half century. Director and participant Lynne Sachs, who wrote her own series of 50 poems for every year of her life, guides her collaborators across the landscape of their memories. She gives each person the same historical timeline as a catalyst for an exploration of the relationship between their personal lives and the times in which they have lived. Initially strangers with nothing in common but their age, the group works together writing, performing and filming. Using the backdrop of the horizon as it meets the water in each of NYC's five boroughs as well as abstracted archival material, Sachs' project becomes an activator in the resurrection of complex, sometimes paradoxical reflections. In the dreamscape of the movie, each participant embraces shards of the past, knowing that his or her connection to a historical moment may be tenuous but allowing for that ambiguity and mystery. In this way, traditional timelines are replaced by a multi-layered, cinematic architecture that both speaks to and visualizes the nature of historical expression."

 documentary ," Despite its nearly four-hour running time, this is a uniquely personal look at movies from one of the late 20th century's great directors and film historians. The film consists of head & shoulder shots of Scorsese speaking into the camera for a minute or two, followed by 10-15 minutes of film clips with Scorsese voice-over. Scorsese approaches the films in terms of how they affected him as a director foremost and as a storyteller/film fan second. Segments include ""The Director as Smuggler,"" ""The Director as Iconoclast"", and so on. The Journey begins with silent masters like D.W. Griffith and ends in 1969 - when Scorsese began to make films; as he says in closing, ""I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries."""
 documentary ," The cinematic journey takes us on a 45,000 kilometer (28,000 miles) train ride through the United States of America in search of the remaining fragments of the '(All) American Dream'. The documentary film takes stock of a nation that was built up 150 years ago by a network of railroads, and which today is at a crossroads with its social, economic and infrastructural situation. This stocktaking of the USA through the windows of a train compartment invites its audience to take part in a wondrous journey. The sight of backyards, industrial zones and private gardens offers us glimpses of life behind the facade of a country (of dreams). Between the scenic pictures, American passengers tell their stories of how their personal situations and those of their companions have changed over the years, what the future holds for them, and how they still believe in and hold onto the (All) American Dream."
 documentary ," A fascinating documentary about Piet Zwart (1885-1977), an idiosyncratic and stubborn designer, who lived for innovation and prepared the way for the international success that is now known as Dutch Design. Piet Zwart worked as an interior and industrial designer, commercial typographer, photographer, critic and lecturer, playing a key role in defining the design climate in the Netherlands in the Twentieth Century. He is especially known for designing the famous 'Piet Zwart' kitchen for the Dutch company Bruynzeel: a kitchen that could be easily produced and consisted of standardized elements. His versatility and influence on present-day designers led the Association of Dutch Designers to award him the title of ""Designer of the Century"" in 2000. Piet Zwart is counted among the international avant-garde without any reservations. His work reflects the work of artists such as Kurt Schwitters, El Lissitzky, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Jan Tschichold, but always retains its own authenticity. His work corresponded with similar experiments at the Bauhaus, where Piet Zwart was a teacher. This documentary enters the mind of the artist Piet Zwart with his almost obsessive urge to innovate."
 documentary ," The chars of the Brahmaputra are a curious geographical feature of the river - they are small, temporary land masses, almost like islands, that appear and disappear seasonally due to erosion. They are also places that many immigrant communities of Assam call home. They farm on the transient land masses and raise their families there as well. Waiting for a Storm explores this ephemeral relationship between the chars and their residents through the prism of two different subjects - Amjad Ali, a farmer who lives on such a char and Sahjahan Hussain, a young activist from the mainland who is working for land rights of the char dwellers. Through their voices the film navigates questions of identity and reform. And as their paths converge, Amjad and Sahjahan's future remains as uncertain as the receding landscape surrounding them."

 documentary ," ""A Reel Man"" is a profile of Skip Elsheimer, a Raleigh, North Carolina resident who collects educational films. Skip started collecting these 16mm films many years ago, and he now has almost 17,000, crammed into almost every room in his house. His archive - one of the biggest of its kind in the United States - includes films from the 1940s, '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s on every conceivable instructional topic - sex education, personal hygiene, public safety, driver's ed, occupational training, the dangers of drugs and alcohol, religion, patriotism, how to be popular, etc. I was attracted to Skip because I find compelling his genuine affection for these ""orphan"" films, his obsession for collecting, categorizing and preserving them, and his passion for sharing them with the public at his A/V Geeks shows. The films in Skip's archive are campy, amusing and not a little propagandistic, but they're also valuable, fascinating time capsules that reflect America's social attitudes and cultural values throughout the last half-century."

 documentary ," Two hours west of Havana in the rust colored countryside sits Vinales, a destination famous for growing some of the best tobacco in the world, where everything is done by hand, fields are still plowed with oxen and the modern world slips away. Campesino celebrates the lives of the Cuban tobacco farmer as introduced to us by an American whose passion has been to photograph them for 15 years. Carl Oelerich is a hard working family man who makes his living as a skycap at the Salt Lake City International Airport. An amateur photographer, with a gift, Carl's B&W images taken throughout the years on film beautifully capture a world on the brink of extinction. Carl begins his journey as an impartial observer, but over the years what begins as a photographic project with his subjects and business relationship with his local guide Juan, turns into something deeper. Despite not sharing a common language, the Campesino's warm to Carl and he to them. It is through Carl's long lasting relationships and striking photographs that we embark on this journey with a cast of characters whose candid conversations overflow with insight, love, humor and gratitude. Here is a peek into rural Cuba that few westerners have seen. Among the many stories we meet a 98 year old horseback riding cowboy philosopher, a teenage girl (that Carl first photographed at the age of 3) that has a head for physics and a sweet and charismatic tobacco farmer that is a killer salsa dancer and devoted practitioner of Santeria. But after all of these years his long time guide and friend Juan begins to question just how deep and lasting their friendship is. Will Carl finally step away from behind the lens and bring their families together? Campesino is a story about friendship, transformation and merging worlds, even those we like to keep all to ourselves. An amateur photographer, who works as a skycap at Salt Lake City Airport, documents the disappearing way of life of Cuba's Campesino farmers, forging friendships and capturing dignity and sacrifice through his surprisingly intimate pictures."
 documentary ," In 1979, Jon Alpert, a young journalist from New York who worked for NBC and had already accomplished several journalistic works in Cuba, had the audacity to ask the Cuban government to accompany Fidel Castro on his plane to The United Nations. Fidel was going to give a speech as President of the Non-Aligned Countries and Jon got permission from Fidel himself to a rare and never before granted access to a communication outlet, especially in the United States. Since the incident with Immigration of the Cuban delegation upon arrival in New York City until his return to Havana, Fidel allowed Jon and his cameras to enter where he was staying at the Cuban Mission in New York, including his bedroom. Frank Vales, Fidel's then translator, was also on this trip and attests to Jon and Fidel's rapport. You could say that besides being a never before seen documentary, ""A Trip with Fidel"" has traits that resemble what many years later could be seen as a reality show where Jon captured a level of intimacy never seen before without losing sight of him for a minute.

 documentary ," Robert Peston travels to China to investigate how this mighty economic giant could actually be in serious trouble. China is now the second largest economy in the world and for the last 30 years China's economy has been growing at an astonishing rate. While Britain has been in the grip of the worst recession in a generation, China's economic miracle has wowed the world. Peston reveals what has actually happened inside China since the economic collapse in the west in 2008. It is a story of spending and investment on a scale never seen before in human history - 30 new airports, 26,000 miles of motorways and a new skyscraper every five days have been built in China in the last five years.

This has now left the Chinese economy with huge debts and questions over whether much of the money can ever be paid back. Robert Peston reveals how China's extraordinary spending has left the country with levels of debt that many believe can only end in an economic crash with untold consequences for us all."

 documentary ," At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the Nor-tec phenomenon emerged from the border city of Tijuana and through the Internet, quickly conquered a global audience. Marketed as a kind of ""ethnic"" electronic dance music, Nor-tec samples sounds of traditional music from the north of Mexico, and transforms them through computer technology used in European and American techno music and electronica. Tijuana has media links to both Mexico and the United States, with peoples, currencies, and cultural goods--perhaps especially music--from both sides circulating intensely within the city. Older residents and their more mobile, cosmopolitan-minded children thus engage in a constant struggle with identity and nationality, appropriation and authenticity. Nor-tec music in its very composition encapsulates this city's struggle, resonating with issues felt on the global level, while holding vastly different meanings to the variety of communities that embrace it. With an impressive hybrid of musicology, ethnomusicology, cultural and performance studies, urbanism, and border studies, this documentary explores all facets."

That all changed in June, 2011 when he was forced to resign in disgrace after admitting that he did tweet lewd ""headless"" photos of himself from his public Twitter account to women he met online, and that it was not the work of a hacker or that the photos were of someone else. At the time, his wife 'Huma Abedin' (qv), herself a key aide to 'Hillary Clinton' (qv), was pregnant with their first child, she who decided to stand by her man.

The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammad, dreamed of transforming a sleepy fishing village into the ultimate metropolis of the 21st century. To make his dream come true, he turned Dubai into the biggest construction site the world has ever known.

They just want to feed their children back home and carve out better lives for themselves. Instead, they work twelve hour days, six days a week and make 50 cents to 1 dollar an hour. No overtime.

 documentary ," For fifteen million years orangutans roamed tropical forests from China to South East Asia. In Borneo, one of their last island outposts, lives one today who is a legend. He's won more than just a kingdom, he's won human hearts. They gave him the name Kusasi. The Orangutan King is the story of Kusasi's life told to us by a remarkable witness. Dr Birute M. Galdikas has been researching orangutans in Borneo for over 40 years. Under the guidance of Louis Leakey, Galdikas joined Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey to become a pioneer of Great Ape field research. Together they were known as the 'trimates', or 'Leakey's Angels'. Yet while Goodall's chimpanzees and Fossey's gorillas were made familiar through films, the orangutans are still largely unknown to television audiences. Their solitary lives high in the tree canopy have made them difficult to follow and film. Now, for the first time, Dr Galdikas will draw audiences deep into the orangutan universe. With enthusiasm and insight she tells us this special story - taking us back 30 years and unfolding Kusasi's story with detail, energy, and the wonder that she still feels for the orangutan species. As a three year old orphan, Kusasi fell under the care of Galdikas in her forest research camp. But driven by a cunning and tenacious spirit Kusasi did not behave as the other ex-captive infants. From the moment he arrived until today, Galdikas has watched Kusasi fight to win back and then succeed at life in the wild. And he's achieved what had once seemed impossible, reaching the top of the power hierarchy and ruling for ten years. The people who work at Camp Leakey enjoy his charisma, and even those who only visit him in his forest kingdom are struck with awe. As Julia Roberts was in 1997. Her encounter with Kusasi was unplanned - becoming a tight clinch with an irritable 140 kilo beast, possessing the strength of ten men. But she was unharmed. Kusasi is not malicious, and he's respected as much for his indifference to humans as for his power over the other orangutans. Today his spirit still burns brightly but his physical strength is fading. His fights with the rogue males who cross his borders are weakening him and The Orangutan King is the last chance for us to see him in power. But the hope of this film is that he will not be the last of his kind to rule with such strength in his forests. If the forest destruction can be stopped, there is a long future for the considerable Kusasi bloodline."

 documentary ," There is currently a spiritual awakening happening worldwide. After being suppressed and told what is normal by religious institutions for long periods of history, people today can speak their mind and practice alternative beliefs as they wish. They are not fearful of any repercussions or any stigma attached. They are Spiritualists, and Spiritualism is here to stay. Memoirs of a Medium looks at the current spiritual revolution from the perspective of the people involved. We tell the true life story of Sean Conway as he comes to understand that he is a spiritual medium. Sean was just like any child growing up in the seventies, coming from a large family in a small house in Sligo. He spent his days exploring the countryside with his identical twin brother Liam. All seemed well by day, however by night Sean was being visited by strange visitors, people from the distant past. Petrified by fear, Sean told others of his experiences, but they fell on deaf ears. With nowhere to turn, not even his twin brother, he began to feel isolated and decided to not speak of it. Only when he meets Asha, his spiritual mother, does he discover his true calling, spiritual medium-ship. With change however, came resistance, from both his inner self and also the people around him. We explore how after first being frightened of ridicule, he now uses his gift to help others. Reflecting the complexity of medium-ship and spirituality as a religion, academic experts and grassroots activists explain this shift in beliefs and tell us what they are exactly. They tell of the benefits certain people gain from medium-ship. Shot on location in Ireland, Memoirs of a Medium reveals this new spiritual revolution. It asks what is a medium and how does one become one?"

 documentary ," Filmed in the heart of Chicago, across the uninhabited Icelandic interior, and on the sea cliffs of volcanic Heimaey Island, the program provides a window to two lands and its people; one urban and American, the other, wild, wondrous, and inhabited by modern-day descendants of ancient Vikings, and to a delightful little bird that most of us would never get a chance to see. The film begins by tracking the expedition of the project's lead zoologist across the entire length of Iceland, taking in an amazing landscape of waterfalls, glaciers, hot springs and geysers and spending a day with a rural Icelandic family living on the country's north coast, only a few miles from the Arctic Circle. He then travels by ship to the only inhabited island in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, located off of Iceland's south coast. Here, the zoologist is joined by a handful of colleagues, who set to work on the steep coastal bluffs to humanely capture and crate for air transport to the U.S. several dozen newly-born, downy puffins. The film then shifts to Chicago, where the birds are held in quarantine at a remote site while the final touches are being put on the new building and seabird habitat they will live in. Here we join the building's architect and engineer as they guide us through the unique design, construction, and layers of complex technology and machinery required to create in terrain, temperature, and lighting of an exacting replica of Iceland ideal for the North Atlantic puffin, but located in the heart of Chicago's cityscape. Finally, the film records the puffins' arrival, veterinary examinations, and climatic entry into their new home that, for nearly 4 million zoo visitors per year -- and on a busy day, more than 200 busloads of city school children -- will provide a ""window to a world"" they've only heard of or read about in textbooks."

After the local transit authority had worked for nearly a year with Beavercreek's public works staff to develop a plan to add 3 new stops to the end of the route, the process was stymied by concerned members of City Council and vocal residents. In the wake of City Council's vote to reject the application, an Ohio legal aid group filed a complaint on behalf of the organized community members who supported the new bus stops, kicking off a two year investigation by the Federal Highway Administration and a series of policy and publicity battles. As racial tension swells in the wake of controversial incidences between law enforcement and young black men, Free To Ride is a promising story about how hard work, collaboration, and the accountability systems can yield fair and just outcomes for all."

What started with a single show way back in 1983 has since blossomed into a three decade long career of four virtuoso musicians and one of the most unique and fascinating bands to ever grace a stage. While PHISH approached the 30th anniversary of the band's first show, Philly Philms began pre-production on ""We've Got It Simple"" while touring with the band in the summer, fall and holiday tours of 2013.

The unique community that has spawned from the band and their music is the focus of the film with a specific slant on the creative and artistic world that Phish fans reside in. From the smallest trinkets sold on lot that allow fans to ""tour"" with the band each year to the established worlds of pin and poster artists, Phish fans have in sense created an underground art collective made up entirely of fans of the band, who create, sell, trade and very often give art to each other in the community.

As a society we devote a great deal of attention to treating cancer, but very little to treating the human being who is dying of cancer.

Through the eyes of patients, their loved ones, therapists, and researchers, A New Understanding examines the use of psilocybin in a controlled setting to reduce psychospiritual anxiety, depression, and physical pain. The treatment aims to help the patient understand that a 'good' death is possible, and to help the patient's family deal well with the dying process. A New Understanding shows patients and their families coming to terms with dying through the skillful treatment of the whole human being.

Through poignantly honest narration, and observational scenes of high emotion, his daughter records the family's recovery during the months after the bomb. Using the camera becomes her way of dealing with the suddenness of the family's changed reality, and a way of re-visiting the haunting images of the bomb-site - a place of both horror and hope."

 documentary ," The Westmont Theatre has been a local icon in a quiet suburban New Jersey town for over 80 years. Called, ""The Grand Old Lady"" the theater building,long closed and decaying, is now at the center of talks of redevelopment and possible demolition. This is the last chance for her to tell her story before she dies. Few are aware of the theater's impact on the life and career of Steven Spielberg and Michael Landon, or how she effected and played a part in history of other major films including The Exorcist and Kramer v. Kramer. A boarded up time capsule, a relic of a day of bygone old vaudeville-movie theater palaces, her story is captured by a curious filmmaker, Brent J. Donaway, who grew up in the shadow of the theater, but was too young to have set foot in the inside when films were last shown there two decades ago. Donaway has a tour guide, a older seasoned veteran of working inside this and other local theaters. They track down projectionists, ushers, ticket sellers, moviegoers from the theater and place them back in their locations to tell their stories. They tell stories of a part of the movie industry seldom examined; some are funny, some sad, some shocking, but all nostalgic and interesting. In doing so, Donaway has not only captured the story of one old-time theater; he has captured a microcosm that paints a picture of old movie houses everywhere, almost all of which are now gone. It is a story with universal appeal."

 documentary ," Unique in the genre of exploration and adventure films, ICE PEOPLE takes you on one of the earth's most seductive journeys-Antarctica. Emmy-winning documentary filmmaker Anne Aghion spent four months ""on the ice"" with modern-day polar explorers, to find out what drives dedicated researchers to leave the world behind in pursuit of science, and to capture the true experience of living and working in this extreme environment. And, as it turns out, the film also witnesses one of the most significant discoveries about climate change in recent Antarctic science. Intense public focus on climate change has turned the shores of Antarctica into a new tourist mecca, making the earth's coldest continent the hot place to be. But, inland from the penguins and ice floes is a magical Antarctica of volcanoes, boulder-strewn valleys and ominous glaciers. Only a small number of scientific research teams get there, braving severe conditions to learn about our planet's history, and make predictions about our future. ICE PEOPLE heads out into the ""deep field"" with noted geologists Allan Ashworth and Adam Lewis, and two undergrad scientists-in-the-making, where they scour across hundreds of miles to find tiny, critical signs of ancient life. Their findings would give the first evidence of a green Antarctica over 14 million years ago, that disappeared with a sudden shift in the temperature of the continent. The most authentic film about life on the ice since the trailblazing expeditions to Antarctica chronicled nearly a century ago, ICE PEOPLE conveys the vast beauty, the claustrophobia, the excitement and the stillness of an experience set to nature's rhythm."

 documentary ," This fascinating region was set apart as a Government Reservation, to be known as Yellowstone Park, in 1S72. The park proper is about 62 miles long, from north to south, and 54 miles wide. While the tourist may reach the park entrance by rail, it has been decreed by Uncle Sam that beyond the Great Lava Arch Gateway the iron horse shall not trespass. So here leaving the pathway of steel we take our place on one of the six-horse coaches that run from Gardiner up to Mammoth Hot Springs. Coaching, Troops, Morris Basin, Great Fountain, Pack mules, Riverside Geyser, Old Faithful, Deer and Bear, Upper Falls, Canyon, Field Glasses. Standing on a balcony at Artist's Point we take up the field glass to have a tele-photo panorama of these weird walls with their clinging pine trees. We look down the Great Gorge. On either side walls of exquisite color rise with here and there pinnacle-like great church spires. Above our heads fly eagles who build their nests and raise their young on the top of these lofty peaks. The scene is a powerful one and beyond words, but the Great Falls add force and quality of action which tempers and dignities the whole scene. This enormous volume of water that looks like a curtain of lace, tumbles over a cliff of volcanic rock 310 feet. Here the traveler finds himself spellbound, held by the pure beauty of the scene. In turning away he pauses to marvel at the wonders of nature and the beauties of our great national playground."
 documentary ," Abandoned or held in low regard by colonial viceroys, businessmen, bishops and high-ranking military men, the gradual conquest of Sonora would be the work of combative spirits from the ambitious Jesuit missionaries to its conquerors' ambitions and conflicts. To the north of the RÃ­o Fuerte, Sonora's old indigenous nations, especially the Yaquis and the Mayos would be forced to establish a secular battle of resistance: a struggle so great that it stands without comparison to any other struggle of this kind in Mexican history. From the long and violent encounters between white colonizers and Sonora's proud Indians, it is only logical that a strong character and a lively, decisive temperament would surface among Sonora's residents today."

 documentary ," The Nigerian film industry, known as Nollywood, has exploded in the last ten years. Now the most popular cinema in all of west Africa--even more popular than imports of Hollywood or Bollywood films--the Nigerian film industry has distinguished itself by shooting all films (called video films) on digital video. This has allowed production schedules to be compressed (films are shot in several days) and immediately brought to market (distribution consists of bringing films to Idumota electronics market in Lagos and selling them for home viewing). The sheer volume of Nigerian video films is staggering: one estimate has a film being produced for each day of the year. Nollywood is now the third-largest film industry in the world, generating US$286 million a year for the Nigerian economy. And yet this vibrant, profitable industry is virtually unknown outside of Africa. Jamie Meltzer, director of ""Off the Charts: The Song Poem Story,"" which premiered on PBS' prestigious Independent Lens series has created a fascinating look into this newly emerging film industry, exploring its peculiar inner workings, economic challenges, and diverse array of colorful films. Traveling to the country's chaotic capitol, Lagos, Meltzer spent six weeks following three of Nigeria's hottest directors, each different in personality and style, as they shot their films about love, betrayal, war, and the supernatural. ""Welcome to Nollywood"" tells the stories of these three directors and their latest productions, while also using interviews with scholars, actors, and journalists who celebrate the industry in insightful and often humorous ways, the Nigerian video-film industry as a whole, its unique character and genres, as well as its impact on the culture of west Africa and Africans at home and abroad."

 documentary ," The Parking Lot Movie is a documentary about a singular parking lot in Charlottesville, Virginia. The film follows a select group of parking lot attendants and their strange rite of passage. The eccentric brotherhood of attendants consist of grad students, overeducated philosophers, surly artists, middle-age slackers and more. This self-described ""ragtag group of fractured poets"" prefer skateboards and bicycles to cars and have at best a tolerant contempt for the people they serve. That's not to say they don't care about anything. They hang out at the lot even in their spare time, shooting the breeze or playing a spirited game of ""flip cone,"" just because...they like it there. They conduct their own private ""war"" against the elites, the pretentious and obnoxious customers who park their BMWs, Hummers, Suburbans and other vehicles. They study the art of doing nothing and the knack of getting even with rude, SUV-driving dolts who treat them like inferior beings. The gradual devolution from enthusiasm to resentment in the psyches of guys self-aware enough to notice it is an interesting process; in an attempt to distract themselves from the rapidly mounting bitterness, the attendants amuse themselves any way they can-stenciling random messages on the parking gate, writing songs, even dancing for tips. Through interviews with former attendants who have moved on - we see that their time at the lot has clearly provided rites of passage and afforded them Zen-like perspective. As one parking attendant laments, ""We had it all in a world that had nothing to offer us."" If the intersection between the status quo and the quest for freedom is their ultimate challenge, could a slab of asphalt be an emotional way station for The American Dream?"

This is Frederick Wiseman's third film about communities, the others being ASPEN and BELFAST, MAINE.

The film tackles the tragic side of our often achievement-obsessed culture, with interviews that explore the hidden world of over-burdened schedules, student suicide, academic cheating, young people who have checked out. RACE TO NOWHERE asks the question: Are the young people of today prepared to step fully and productively into their future?

Generous sponsorship by Altec and Kermel, and support from Burndy, BEUCI, Northwestern Energy, NECA, IBEW, and IFD also contributed to the film. The first Storm Soldiers film was a story about the electrical utility industry itself documenting its history, its homeland, and its heroes. Through the first film, America was introduced to the men and women who literally put their lives on the line every day to keep electricity flowing. Storm Soldiers provided a comprehensive look into what linemen do, why they do it, and how truly dangerous their work is. In addition to raising significant funds for charity, Storm Soldiers introduced America to an almost invisible hero: The Lineman. Storm Soldiers II is a deeper, more personal story. This story is about the linemen and the industry's impact on their lives and families. Juxtaposing the linemen at home against their work and how their families see their jobs, Storm Soldiers II also documents what it's like for linemen to work in dangerous and extreme conditions. Linemen often arrive to disaster scenes before first responders in order to ensure safety for rescue crews and help restore infrastructure.

These men and women represent the over 100,000 linemen in America who work without complaints or excuses."

 documentary ," Political heavy-weights populate this urgent and humorous documentary on the detonative mix of art and politics as embodied in the work of infamous ""guerilla"" poster artist Robbie Conal, a professional painter who estimates that hundreds of thousands of his caricatured paintings-as-posters have been splattered across the United States' urban streets, militantly affixed by himself and his cult following of urban guerilla volunteers to construction sites, traffic light switching boxes and any other surface area large enough to house one of these satirical images. Specializing in what he calls ""info-tainment,"" Conal's posters offer an immediate response to today's headlines through the expressionistically decaying depiction of the socially and politically powerful accompanied by several words of dichotomous text. Beginning in 1986 with the onset of the Iran-Contra scandal, Conal has distributed his work in a way even Andy Warhol might not have dreamed possible. As Conal modestly points out, ""these are some of the most famous paintings of any contemporary artist because I make you see them whether you want to or not."" The original canvases, from which the posters are reproduced, simultaneously grace elite gallery walls and wealthy collectors' homes. Post No Bills foregrounds the tension between Conal's creative process and the lures of a desperate notoriety achieved through catering to the newsmedia's craving for controversy in his journey to express himself and benefit from the notoriety generated from his endeavors. In September 1990, after ""reasonably outspoken"" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates casually stated that ""casual drug users ought to be taken out and shot,"" Conal began collaboration with student Patrick Crowley on a poster criticizing this hyperbolic remark. When an outraged world focused on Los Angeles in March of 1991 with the release of the graphic video footage of the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers, Conal and Crowley took to the L.A. streets his most daring, inciting and inflammatory image to date; a poster depicting the police chief on a full torso N.R.A. shooting target with the text ""casual drug users ought to be taken out and beaten. Post No Bills concentrates on this poster of Gates, including an interview with the beleaguered Chief himself, celebrating the potential of this piece of political street art and exposing the dissociation to be made between Conal and his subject matter. A documentary look at artist Robbie Conal. Conal paints political posters and then organizes gangs of folks to plaster them up all over town. The film visits his L.A. studio as he paints and as he turns out posters; he talks about his work. We also watch his volunteers out on the streets putting up the posters, and we see the cityscape decorated with his art. The soundtrack includes public utterances by Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Ollie North, Tammy Faye Baker, and others whom Conal's guerrilla art skewers."

 documentary ," Ethnic Notions is Marlon Riggs' Emmy-winning documentary that takes viewers on a disturbing voyage through American history, tracing for the first time the deep-rooted stereotypes which have fueled anti-black prejudice. Through these images we can begin to understand the evolution of racial consciousness in America. Loyal Toms, carefree Sambos, faithful Mammies, grinning Coons, savage Brutes, and wide-eyed Pickaninnies roll across the screen in cartoons, feature films, popular songs, minstrel shows, advertisements, folklore, household artifacts, even children's rhymes. These dehumanizing caricatures permeated popular culture from the 1820s to the Civil Rights period and implanted themselves deep in the American psyche. Narration by Esther Rolle and commentary by respected scholars shed light on the origins and devastating consequences of this 150 yearlong parade of bigotry. Ethnic Notions situates each stereotype historically in white society's shifting needs to justify racist oppression from slavery to the present day. The insidious images exacted a devastating toll on black Americans and continue to undermine race relations."

 documentary ," This first time feature filmmaker takes an up close and personal look at the multi billion dollar video game industry. Beginning with its history, ""It's In The Game"" exposes the questionable marketing tactics, quality of life issues and class action lawsuits filed against the world's leading video game publisher, Electronic Arts Video games have become multi-billion dollar profit machines in the 21st century. A recent study by the Entertainment Software Association found that $73 million in high definition television sales (HDTV) can be directly attributed to sales of the Xbox 360. The film ""Spiderman 2"" grossed $115 million dollars at the box office on its opening weekend in 2004.

 documentary ," Love at the Twilight Motel is a film about how Latin attitudes towards love and sex are meeting America at the intersection of 8th Street and Rte 826 in Miami. The Twilight Motel is the busiest motel in the city. It rents rooms by the hour and is one of many on 8th Street - the major east-west artery through the city and the heart of Little Havana. Motels like the Twilight are Latin American institutions that were introduced to the United States by Miami's large Cuban and Latin American population. The motel presents a veneer of everyday normalcy. Chambermaids go about their chores in the hot Miami light. A green gecko poses against pink stucco. A retro neon sign looms over the lazy hum of city traffic. But behind the row of uniform doors an all-too-human drama is playing out in the shadows. In one room, an elderly Cuban American, the very image of traditional breadwinner, waits for one of his several, younger girlfriends. In another, a newly married young guy lamely justifies his serial cheating. Next door an aging blonde, wearily preparing for the next john, wonders about the direction her life has taken. With Love at the Twilight Motel, filmmaker Alison Rose enters this world of duplicity and dysfunction, fashioning a compassionate and stylish account of love, loss and the human condition. Through a gallery of strikingly conceived character studies -- sharply etched yet achingly universal -- she captures the pathos and pain of her subject's damaged lives. Rose, broken and beautiful, reveals a heart-rending story of abuse and delusion. Richard, a study in a macho bravado, happily pursues his destiny bedding married women. While Cadillac, an ex-pimp and thief, assesses his life spent in pursuit of the next crack hit. Love at the Twilight Motel draws upon a rich documentary tradition to reflect upon the secrets we conceal and the tangled webs we weave. The half-century-old Cuban-American community of Miami's Little Havana has its own rituals, a secret world behind the facade of Latin-American virtue that reflects a practical attitude toward sex and infidelity. It's the world explored in the frank and candid Love at the Twilight Motel - a film that offers a glimpse of the passions and personalities that converge in the busiest strip of by-the-hour motels in the city. Welcome to Love at the Twilight Motel where motel rooms rent by the hour and housekeepers are always on duty. Here your secrets are safe, and as long as you respect the rules of the establishment, your room is your temporary home. Past the motel entrance sign, you are hidden from the city behind high walls and lush hedges. Ahead of you, the parking lot is nearly full. A green striped awning shades the entrance to the office. For added privacy, some rooms have their own parking and private walk-up. It is discreet and always busy. Behind a row of uniform doors a multi-character drama of duplicity and dysfunction is playing out in the shadows. In one room an elderly married businessman waits for one of his young girlfriends. In another a sad blonde prepares for her next john. Next door a young husband loses another day to addiction. Entering a world of infidelity and delusion, the documentary fashions a compassionate account of love, loss and the tangled webs we weave. The motel and its clients are an intersection of American classes and cultures - Latin-, Anglo- and African-, wealthy and poor. There are 20 hourly motels on S.W. 8th Street alone - the old main east-west artery through the city and the heart of Little Havana. They are Latin American institutions that were introduced to the United States by Miami's large Cuban and Latin American population."

 documentary ," Although our actions for the past 150 years have lifted our civilization to new heights, it has come at a tremendous price. We are now at a point where humanity's demands for natural resources far exceed the earth's capacity to sustain us. The extraction and the consumption of these resources in the past two centuries have changed our climate and ecosystems so significantly, that a new geological era had to be created. For some decades now people have been talking about saving the planet, but we are realizing that this is not really the issue. The central issue is civilization itself and whether we can save it. The stresses that we have put on the earth are not only threatening our habitat, but our way of life, our prosperity and even our existence on the planet. Our current paradigm must change. We will have to accept the new reality; the human economy is part of nature and not the other way around.

Not only was Viktor Yushchenko banned from access to state-owned radio and television, he was poisoned, leaving him in terrible pain, his face severely scarred by a toxin. When the state declared Viktor Yanukovich the winner, contrary to the results of any credible exit poll, the people had had enough.

 documentary ," During the '35th Cannes International Film Festival' (14th-26th May 1982), German director 'Wim Wenders' (qv) asked a sample of 15 other international film directors to get, each one at a time, into the same hotel room to answer in solitude the same question about the future of cinema, while they were filmed with a 16mm camera and recorded with a Nagra sound recorder. In social sciences the goal of standardization is that each person is exposed to the same question experience, and that the recording setting of answers is the same, too, so that any differences in the answers can be correctly interpreted as reflecting differences between persons rather than differences in the process that produced the answer. The wide sampling frame in ""Room 666"" included European 'auteurs' and Hollywood directors, narrative and experimental filmmakers, male and female professional film directors that presented their films or were simply present at the 35th Cannes Festival in May 1982. The directors came from France, Italy, Brazil, Lebanon, Germany, Turkey, the Philippines and the USA. This unique documentary shows the complete footage (or selected parts) of the 15 answers that resulted from this 'standardized survey interviews'. The historical value of ""Room 666"" has increased over time: The 5 directors 'Rainer Werner Fassbinder' (qv), 'Yilmaz GÃ¼ney' (qv), 'Maroun Bagdadi' (qv), 'Robert Kramer (I)' (qv) and 'Michelangelo Antonioni' (qv) have died since then in this order. Fassbinder died only a few weeks later on June 10th 1982 and gave his last 'interview' in ""Room 666"".

 documentary ," Britain - safe, secure, manicured, ordered. This is the Britain we know, our gardens planted, bordered and clipped. Our lawns neatly mowed, our countryside managed, tamed, trimmed and taken care of. Our animals domesticated and those that are still wild, small and harmless. But all is not well in our green and pleasant land. There have been whispers and rumors. Something has crept back into the woods and made them wild again. Something ancient and powerful, not seen for hundreds of years. Something that may even be dangerous. Human activity has played an integral part in shaping the ecology of the British Isles.

 documentary ," Robert Rauschenberg's art embodies the life-embracing and participatory spirit that characterizes much of American art since the 1950s. Rauschenberg recalls the valuable contacts he made at Black Mountain College, particularly with choreographer Merce Cunningham and composer John Cage, who both had a decisive influence on his thinking. Rauschenberg's active involvement with life carries over into his painting. The combine-painting of the 1950s integrated two- and three-dimensional elements and inhabited both wall and floor space. These assemblages included discarded thrift shop-type objects such as automobile tires, stuffed birds, doors, and electric light fixtures, as well as the two-dimensional painterly surfaces reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism. This intense injection of real objects into his work was translated into another medium in the early 1960s: silkscreen painting. Robert Rauschenberg: Retrospective includes important examples of the artist's diverse and extraordinary accomplishments, tracing his development from his student years and his earliest experiments to a retrospective of his work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York."

 documentary ," Comrade Duch murdered 14,000 people on behalf of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia's Tuol Sleng prison in the 1970 and 1980s. Today, the repentant killer has been confronted by evidence of his horrendous crimes against humanity in a court, and by the people of Cambodia who suffered at his hands. In the Extraordinary Chambers of the Courts of Cambodia, Duch (born Kaing Guek Eav) and onlookers watch wrenching tribunal footage, and face the anguish and anger of relatives of Tuol Sleng victims. Comrade Duch might never have been captured and brought to trial if not for Irish photojournalist Nic Dunlop, who searched tirelessly for Duch until finding him in a remote area near the Thai border, 20 years after his escape from Tuol Sleng and subsequent conversion to evangelical Christianity. Because of the intervening years and the radical change Duch underwent while in hiding, it is not a simple matter to condemn the man. And yet it is especially terrifying to realize this mild-mannered math teacher could have turned turned into such a vicious sadist for years, and then suddenly converted to a peaceful and devout Christian. Perhaps it is simply too much to believe. It is up to the court to decide what justice awaits the born-again executioner."

 documentary ," Sierra Nevada means ""snowy mountains"" in Spanish. This spectacular range runs 400 miles along the eastern edge of California. It is the most avalanche-prone area in the United States, a place where the winter ""Storm King"" produces many devastating snowstorms. This documentary examines three winter weather disasters in the Sierras, starting with the most notorious, the Donner Party. Snowbound over the winter of 1846-1847, of the 81 settlers who went into the mountains, only 45 walked out. Some of the group resorted to cannibalism, which was sensationalized in the press. The second disaster profiled occurred in January 1952 when the luxury streamliner train ""City of San Francisco"" became stuck in Donner Pass by avalanches resulting from extreme snowfall the previous autumn. One engineer was killed and the train's passengers were stranded 3 days without heat before rescue. The third disaster happened at the Alpine Meadows ski resort near Lake Tahoe. The 15-foot snow pack in the spring of 1982 created dangerous avalanche conditions, and on March 31 1982 the resort was closed. On that day an avalanche killed 7 people and buried chair-lift operator Anna Conrad inside an employee building at the lodge. Anna was dug out alive 5 days later."

Seemingly decent young men are selected based on traits viewed as exploitable by the recruiters : illiterate, anti-communist, young and male. The film interviews Michailis Petrou, one of the Greek policeman involved in the tortures who agreed to testify against his peers in exchange for a reduced sentence.

 documentary ," This is a story of a village that lives ahead of its time. The village of the future is on the Balkans, Bulgaria and has the profound name ""Deep Valley"". There is a twice-restored church in the village, a school with a kindergarten, computer club, two studios for arts and crafts, a tennis court; it is frequently roamed by foreigners, summer house dwellers, even film-makers. There are a few things missing however. ""God Given Home"" was the ancient name of the village. What has forced its inhabitants in the course of time to disparage the metaphor implied in its name so that they should not find their nice shelter quite deep any more, even for a valley? Is the answer hidden in the way people were living there or is that just an outcome of their creative humor? Along with the arguing and snickering people of the village the film also has to find the answer to that and many other questions. Such as - what has already been given to us, have we really taken it? No matter how we would look at the everyday life of a Bulgarian village nowadays, at the people there, one thing is clear - we all have been launched from one and the same micro-space and that is nothing more but a tiny universe - all we need is there and it has always been. The way it is. And so much the better, perhaps. Because this might well be ""the universal"" village."

 documentary ," The film seeks to form a ""relationship"" between the artist and her opposition, her antipode: the ""philistine"", as well as between her and her friends, admirers, fans, and serious critics. While via the camera we get a closer look at her life, her artistic and private activities - listening to her, asking her questions, observing and accompanying her - we also catch bits of reactions, comments, commentaries from others, and these we juxtapose symbolically, associatively, or as a kind of verification or support with our artists actions, skills and activities or with the artist herself. Our artist uses herself as her subject rather than the Other or the other thing. She is responsible to herself - in her art as well. We, the makers of this film, remain responsible to HER and the audience. And what exactly is the phenomenon of our unknown artist? The film has provided many possible ways to look at this question. But any answer - in keeping with the intention of the film - must be an individual one."

A Soviet official calls the community response an act of mass heroism and cites individual workers for their courage. The cowardice of a few - a teacher who deserted his class, an engineer who hid out in the villages - is the subject of a party meeting; offenders are expelled, not executed, since this is peacetime, although the subtitles indicate that ""the people's contempt would serve as eternal punishment,"" while the Communist Party and Komsomol cards of those heroes who lost their lives responding to the disaster ""would be displayed in our museums."" The video ends with shots of Chernobyl entombed under tons of concrete and lead.

 documentary ," Brock ""King of the Mountain"" is an action / drama feature film based on the legendary racing car driver Peter Brock, set against the back-drop of the Australian motor racing scene in the late 1980s. Touring Car race drivers were idolized like 'rock stars'. They were demigods who reached mythical proportions of popularity through their death defying skills on the track. Dick Johnson, Allan Moffat and Jim Richards, to name a few, were household names to their adoring fans, but sworn enemies on the track. Then there was Peter Brock. The best of the best. In 1986, Peter Brock was a three-time Australian Touring Car Champion with eight Bathurst 1000 victories under his belt. Along with trusted Co-Driver, business partner and friend John Harvey by his side, Brock had become the most successful driver in Australian touring car history. Brock was always seeking an advantage over the competition, always adapting new technologies from overseas to push the very boundaries of the sport. On the advice of family friend and health practitioner Dr Eric Dowker, Brock sought to improve his own health and fitness. He gave up alcohol and cigarettes, and became a vegan literally overnight. When Peter put his mind to something... Impressed with the results of Dr Dowkers unorthodox methods, Brock started experimenting with crystals and magnets as an ""alternative technology"" to improve a cars performance. Against the wishes of his major partner and supplier of vehicles, General Motors Holden, he ordered the fitting of this new device to his Holden Special Vehicle Commodores. On the eve of the 1987 Australian Touring Car Championship, Brock publicly released a car he had re-designed and modified with an un-tested rear suspension, called the Brock Director. It was a GMH based product and had not been approved. This was against GMH's wishes, who were already unimpressed with the much vaunted polarizer' device. GMH immediately withdrew all support for Brock's Racing Team. Overnight, his empire had collapsed. The Press had a field day, gleefully proclaiming he was yesterday's hero. Old loyalties were tested as friends became foes and with the World Touring Car Championship coming to Mount Panorama, a new breed of hot international driver was threatening to eclipse his legacy. But Brock wasn't finished just yet.... Clawing his way back with the help of some rebel Holden Car Dealers, this film is the remarkable story of how ""Peter Perfect"" became the ""King of the Mountain"" for the ninth time. A record that still stands today."

 documentary ," During the Second World War, as Canada was embroiled in violent conflict with the Axis Powers, nearly 25,000 Canadians of German, Italian and Japanese origin were arrested and interned as ""enemy aliens"". Internment, the indefinite imprisonment or confinement of a group of people in a time of crisis, was the Canadian government's reaction to a perceived threat posed by individuals of questionable loyalty. The Canadian government and public feared that if Italian, German and Japanese Canadians were disloyal, then they could commit sabotage and other subversive acts that would endanger lives and threaten the Canadian war effort. As the theory went, isolating disloyal citizens from the rest of the Canadian population contained the threat. Mass internment, especially of Japanese-Canadians, is undoubtedly a dark chapter in Canadian history. Over 20,000 Japanese-Canadians were subject to deprivation and displacement which was far out of proportion with the threat posed to Canada by that community. Historians and Japanese redress campaigners have rightfully labeled this a ""War on Ethnicity"". But what about the internment of Italian Canadians? Thousands of Italian Canadians were arrested in the wake of Fascist Italy's declaration of war on the United Kingdom and its allies in June 1940. The arrest and internment of Italian Canadians also had clear-cut repercussions for that community, some of which linger to the present day. The controversy and debate surrounding this issue is what historians and filmmakers refer to as ""The Italian Question""."
 documentary ," Photographer Marti Friedlander recounts her life, while her photographs recount her times in this lively, evocative documentary portrait. A high-spirited young woman who'd grown up in an East End orphanage, she worked as an assistant to two major London photographers in the 50s. When she married a New Zealander and moved here in 1958, Bohemian London was suddenly a terribly long way away. Culture shock inspired her earliest photos of New Zealanders, and her richly textured pictures of New Zealand life have continued to merge intimacy, curiosity and an element of formal detachment. Seen here, her images comprise an eloquent picture show of 40 years of social change, corroborated by an array of stunning archival footage. The film explores the mysteries of good photography and the lively interaction between the photographer and her subjects, who range from children, Prime Ministers, back-country farmers, nuns, and rock singers, to artists at work."
 documentary ," A gripping documentary about the courage and determination of a young English stockbroker who saved the lives of 669 children. Between March 13 and August 2, 1939, Nicholas Winton organized 8 transports to take children from Prague to new homes in Great Britain, and kept quiet about it until his wife discovered a scrapbook documenting his unique mission in 1988. Winton was a successful 29-year-old stockbroker in London who ""had an intuition"" about the fate of the Jews when he visited Prague in 1939. He quietly but decisively got down to the business of saving lives. We learn how only two countries, Sweden and Britain, answered his call to harbor the young refugees; how documents had to be forged and how once foster parents signed for the children on delivery, that was the last he saw of them."

 documentary ," Guy Gabaldon died on August 31, 2006 and the world lost someone very special. During the bloody struggle for Saipan in July 1944, U.S. Marine PFC Guy Gabaldon is indeed officially credited with capturing over 1500 Japanese soldiers and civilians - singlehandedly, a record that is untouchable in the annals of American military history. For over sixty years, Guy talked about his exploits on that island, sharing his experience and using his celebrity to inspire new generations who valued bravery and bravado. However, war experience alone does not make a life, and Guy's didn't stop in 1944. He lived many different lives and most importantly he took it upon himself to help the less fortunate, particularly the wayward teenagers he encountered when he returned to the Mariana Islands in 1980, where he would live for twenty years. Guy Gabaldon grew up in East Los Angeles where he spent more time on the streets than at home. He would get into fights and he was thrown out of school at one point, but things began to change when he was introduced to the Japanese American community. Practically adopted by his Nisei school friends, Guy learned about the Japanese culture, its language, and the tight family structure that was alien to him. All of these elements - learned at first hand - would have a dramatic effect on his experiences on Saipan. When his Japanese American friends were interned after Pearl Harbor, Guy, 17, joined the Marine Corps, trained at Camp Pendleton, and was assigned as a scout to the 2nd Regiment of the 2nd Marine Division. His unit was then shipped to Hawaii, and then on into the Central Pacific, where he landed on Saipan, nine days after D-Day in Europe. Saipan was a rocky, cave-strewn island in the Mariana chain. It was part of the Japanese Empire's inner defense perimeter and it had an airfield within striking distance of Japan. It also had a large civilian population of Japanese and native islanders. The American high command in the Pacific had determined that the Marianas - Guam, Tinian and Saipan were a high priority for the war effort. B-29s were now flying and they needed a base to attack Japan. Saipan fit that bill. Guy Gabaldon didn't set out to be a hero. In the first few days of heavy fighting, he simply tried to survive murderous mortar, artillery and machine gun fire. But in succeeding days, he began to go on lone-wolf excursions into the countryside and he brought prisoners back. Japanese prisoners were a bit of an oddity at that time. The credo of most soldiers of the Japanese Army was kill or be killed. Japanese soldiers on Saipan were ordered to kill seven Marines for one Japanese. Thus, the campaign featured one suicide banzai charge after another. Capturing one Japanese was considered a feat - bringing in 1500 was unthinkable. But, amazingly, that's exactly what Guy Gabaldon did during the two months of early fighting on Saipan. At one point, he captured 800 in one day - his commanding officer Captain John Schwabe would later dub him ""The Pied Piper of Saipan."" How did Guy do it? Perhaps it was his language skill - Guy was hardly fluent in Japanese but he spoke the language with a certain inflection that reached into the psyche of the exhausted, hopelessly outnumbered island garrison. He had learned the words on the streets of L.A. with his Japanese-American friends, and those words helped him on the island. Perhaps it was the fact that the Japanese were, in the end, human beings who just couldn't fight anymore. Timing was thus everything. Guy wasn't hesitant to make a point with a hand grenade of a carbine if the enemy proved stubborn. But they eventually came out of their caves and became his prisoner. Guy was later wounded after the island was secured. Astonishingly, he was denied the Congressional Medal of Honor - a medal for which he was recommended by Captain Schwabe of the 2nd Marines. He did receive the Silver Star for his valor, but he was not promoted and left the Marine service as a PFC. Being Hispanic, perhaps, didn't help his cause. Racism and prejudice was rife throughout the U.S. armed forces in World War II and Guy was not immune to it. Guy returned to the United States, married a Japanese woman who was living in Mexico and became a successful pilot and importer. His story was first told on the television program ""This is your Life"" in the late 1950s. That program came to the attention of Hollywood and a movie was produced in 1960 entitled ""Hell to Eternity."" Actor Jeffrey Hunter played Guy. Hunter was your poster boy U.S. Marine - no reference was ever made to his Guy's Hispanic ethnicity. However, the notoriety of the film at that time encouraged the U.S. Navy to award Guy its highest decoration - the Navy Cross. But no Medal of Honor. Today, a strong effort is being waged by Congressmen, private business people and friends of Guy to get him the Medal. It would be measured as a sign of respect, not only to Guy, but to the people in America of Hispanic descent. Production Production on ""East L.A. Marine"" commenced in late 2003. Guy Gabaldon was enlisted as a creative partner on the project, and he was interviewed, at length, at his home outside Gainsville, Florida. We later interviewed his commanding officer, U.S. Marine Colonel John Schwabe, at his winter home in Tucson, Arizona. In June 2004, during the 60th Anniversary celebrations on Saipan, a local DV crew was hired and footage was gathered all over the island. Seventeen additional interviews were completed with returning veterans, local historians and friends of Guys. Guy and his wife had returned to the Island and lived there for many years - so he was well known throughout the Marianas. His autobiographical book Maverick Marine was published in 1990. Much of the footage that was gathered on the island is designed to match combat footage and still photographs taken of the campaign (yesterday and today shots). In early 2005, we interviewed a number of Hispanic veterans in Montebello, California. That May, we met Guy in Corpus Christi, Texas and helped celebrate Memorial Day with him. Footage of Guy participating in solemn commemorative ceremonies combined with nostalgic trips to the U.S.S. Lexington - a U.S. Essex-class aircraft carrier, that participated in the invasion of Saipan, sixty one years ago. In July 2006, Guy was honored by Mayor Antonio Villagairosa and the Los Angeles City Council. He was indeed a ""favorite son"" of the City of Los Angeles. This is the story of an extraordinary man - Guy Gabaldon - a U.S. Marine of Hispanic descent who single-handedly captured over 1100 Japanese during the bloody fighting on Saipan in the summer of 1944. One of the legendary heroes of World War II, Guy Gabaldon's true story is now told for the very first time in EAST L.A. MARINE: THE UNTOLD TRUE STORY OF GUY GABALDON. Guy Gabaldon's roots date back to the time of the Spanish conquistadors in New Mexico. Born in Los Angeles, Guy grew up in Boyle Heights where he spent more time on the streets than at home. He would get into fights and he was thrown out of school at one point, but things began to change when he was introduced to the Japanese American community. Practically adopted by his Nisei school friends, Guy learned about the Japanese culture, its language, and the tight family structure that was alien to him. All of these elements - learned at first hand - would have a dramatic effect on his experiences on Saipan. When his Japanese American friends were interned after Pearl Harbor, Guy, 17, joined the Marine Corps, trained at Camp Pendleton, and was assigned as a scout to the 2nd Regiment of the 2nd Marine Division. His combat unit landed on Saipan, nine days after D-Day in Europe. Saipan was a rocky, cave-strewn island in the Mariana chain. Guy Gabaldon didn't set out to be a hero. In the first few days of heavy fighting, he simply tried to survive murderous mortar, artillery and machine gun fire. But in succeeding days, he began to go on lone-wolf excursions into the countryside and he brought prisoners back. Japanese prisoners were an oddity at that time. The credo of most soldiers of the Japanese Army was kill or be killed. Japanese soldiers on Saipan were ordered to kill seven Marines for one Japanese. Thus, the campaign featured one suicide banzai charge after another. Capturing one Japanese was considered a feat - bringing in over 1500 was unthinkable. But, amazingly, that's exactly what Guy Gabaldon did during the two months of early fighting on Saipan. At one point, he captured 800 in one day - his commanding officer Captain John Schwabe would later dub him ""The Pied Piper of Saipan."" Guy was later wounded after the island was secured. Astonishingly, he was denied the Congressional Medal of Honor - a medal for which he was recommended by Captain Schwabe of the 2nd Marines. He did receive the Silver Star for his valor, but he was not promoted and left the Marine service as a PFC. Being Hispanic, perhaps, didn't help his cause. Racism and prejudice was rife throughout the U.S. armed forces in World War II and Guy was not immune to it. Fifteen years after the end of World War II, Guy's story was dramatized in the 1960 war film, HELL TO ETERNITY. Since there were no Hispanic leading men at that time, producer Irvin Levin decided to cast Jeffrey Hunter as Guy. Hunter was 6'1"" and Caucasian, a poster-boy Marine type. In reality, Guy ""Gabby"" Gabaldon was 5' 3 3/4"" and of Hispanic descent - an important facet of Guy's life that was ignored in the film. Although nicely written by Ted Sherdeman and directed in slam bang style by Phil Karlson (the movie was the first to feature on-screen squib bullet hits on bodies), much of the story was invented and the manner in which General Matsui (""Bridge on the River Kwai's"" Sessue Hayakawa) personally ordered the whole island to surrender to Guy was ludicrous. One positive aspect of HELL TO ETERNITY was that it woke up the Marine Corps to Gabaldon's contribution and he was awarded the Navy Cross at El Toro Marine Air Station in 1960. However, any effort to get the Corps to endorse the Congressional Medal of Honor was stymied. Guy Lewis Gabaldon died of a heart attack on August 31, 2006. He was 80. Today, a strong effort is being waged by Congressmen, private business people and friends of Guy to get him the Medal posthumously. It would be measured as a sign of respect, not only to Guy, but to the people in America of Hispanic descent who fought in World War II. ###"

 documentary ," Chamber Music Wonderland takes viewers on a fascinating musical voyage, accompanying a group of musicians who set up their own music festival to showcase the very best of 500 years of musical history. Avoiding a narrator, the film allows the protagonists the time to explain how they became musicians and what fascinates them about their profession, giving a lot of space to the music which is performed in the baroque splendor of a monastery in Western Austria. In Chamber Music Wonderland, director Emanuel Altenburger accompanies a group of musicians who set up the ""OBERTÃ–NE"" (Overtones) music festival, an event that follows its own rules. Not bound by any dogmatic adherence to a particular style or epoch, the festival covers some 500 years of musical tradition, from the baroque sonatas of Dietrich Buxtehude, to the passionate tango arrangements of Astor Piazzolla. Led by the strong will to perform only the best pieces and connect audiences with new composers, the international group of musicians chose the baroque splendor of the Stams monastery in the Tyrol region of Western Austria for their annual festival. Altenburger, who accompanied the musicians throughout the rehearsing stage and the buildup towards the event's 2016 edition, seeks to delve further into the ensemble's diverse backgrounds. He examines what drove them to become musicians and what motivates them in their profession. By avoiding an independent narrator, Altenburger allows the musicians to tell their story and lets the music speak for itself, taking the viewer past seemingly random pieces of music which come together to create a fascinating musical voyage."

 documentary ," In the early 1980s, at the beginning of what would become a 12-year-long civil war, El Salvador's talented football team was one national institution upon which both the left and the right could agree. When the team pulled off a stunning 1-0 upset against Mexico and qualified to compete in the 1982 World Cup, it was a high point for the tiny country's national pride. Unfortunately, the team's Cinderella story devolved into a nightmarish farce. A corrupt national soccer federation robbed players of their pay and equipment. The team's opening match resulted in a 10-1 loss, still the worst defeat in World Cup history. And yet, Salvadoran players and fans still find much to be proud of in this David-and-Goliath sports story, one of endurance amid adversity."

 documentary ," Once deemed, ""The most dangerous city west of the Santa Fe"", Los Angles was the original 'Wild West'. The incessant hankering of Americans to migrate west for profit and prosperity also brought with it, people who had a strong desire to find a place where they had the freedom to be themselves: in short, people in search of a better life. A true American virtue if ever one was, and Gays & Lesbians were no exception. Queer culture and it's history,is riddled with discrimination, suppression and despair; but also triumph and human spirit. And out of all of it emerged a unique identity and culture. But where did this culture come from? When and where did it begin to take shape? How has it evolved into what we see today? LAQH seeks to answer these questions by shedding light on a part of American history and historical figures who are largely unacknowledged, and in turn create a newfound dialogue about not only LGBTQ history, but how our Gay and Lesbian brothers and sisters effected the world we live in today; which will ultimately create a better understanding of the truly unique and utterly American culture of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender community. Most consider the NY Stonewall Riots of 1969 to be the birth of the Gay civil rights movement. But there have been activists, artists and innovators in L.A. since the turn of the 20th century. From the beloved male and female impersonators who graced the vaudeville stages of the early 1900's, to the Queer designers and artists behind the scenes who made Hollywood the glamour capital of the world, to the wide spread mid-century criminalization of Gays and Lesbians and the brave ones who began to fight back resulting in groundbreaking L.A. based organizations which sparked the Gay civil rights movement across the country and the world."

 documentary ," This film was made at the height of the US-Soviet arms race. George Kennan declared that we were perched on a ""razor's edge of precariousness"", facing irreparable nuclear war. Kennan's proposals brought him to the forefront of the movement to avert a nuclear catastrophe. His credentials as a Pulitzer Prize winning diplomatic historian and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union established him as the most respected American scholar of Soviet strategic policies. Kennan's opinions are based on years of experience in East-West affairs; he witnessed first hand the beginnings of the US-Soviet conflict during World War II, which eventually led to the seemingly permanent division of Europe.

 documentary ," Murmurations (Rome) is a video that comments on history's ghostly spectre in the everyday. The video employs footage shot at two sites in Rome, Italy. The first is the Foro Italico, an extensive sports complex inspired by the Roman forums of the imperial age and lauded as a preeminent example of Italian Fascist architecture. The site is paved with large-scale mosaics celebrating Mussolini's Fascist regime. The second site is the Fosse Ardeatine, an ancient Roman catacomb where, during World War II, 330 Italian civilians were massacred and mass-buried by German occupation troops as a reprisal for a partisan attack conducted against the SS Police. The historical events that defined these two sites have long since passed. They remain in an odd form of stasis, and only a lingering murmur exists of them in the contemporary world. Murmurations (Rome) documents the act of walking through these historical sites, focusing on the direct and experiential engagement of moving through these spaces as a means of potentially reanimating their political and ideological significance today. Additionally, documentation of the intricately morphing formation of starlings in flight-called murmurations- that descend upon Rome each evening, is presented along with excerpts from a poem by Pier Paolo Pasolini, 'Le Cenere di Gramsci' (1954)."
 documentary ," Documentary film about allotment gardens in the south Luxembourg. Allotment gardens are small plots of land made available for individual gardening, and organized in a community. The tradition goes back to the beginnings of steel production in this region. Today witnesses the end of this era, as well as a profound change in Luxembourg's society, under heavy influence of its nearly 50% immigrant population. These changes are mirrored in the daily life of the garden communities: a microcosm where retired Luxembourgers clash with Portuguese construction workers, or a new wave of immigrants from former Yugoslavia. All with their own habits in regard to gardening, growing cabbages, building garden shacks, or simply having barbecue parties. Filmed over four seasons, like a leisurely stroll through the garden communities, ""Garden Stories"" manages to keep a light tone, a touch of humor, without losing sight of the bigger picture. What might be considered an anachronistic legacy of an industrial past, is actually a very lively culture, a laboratory for integration. Also, in times of economic strain, notions of subsistence gardening are suddenly not so outdated anymore. The film sets out to meet the gardeners on a personal level, in natural surroundings where nature competes with industry, wilderness with civilization, and where these very concepts of nature and civilization are being questioned."

 documentary ," Aaron's improbable odyssey began simply enough, walking his dog at the beach. As he used his palm to smooth over some sand to make a place to sit down and take a rest, he grazed over a buried hypodermic needle. He picked it up, relieved to not have been cut and looked around him - plastic garbage strewn all over. Were there more? His place of peace and reflection suddenly felt dangerous. He went home, picked up a rake and headed back to clean up: straws, cheese spreaders, tire caps, toothbrushes, bottle caps, army men, bubble blowers, shotgun shells. This was the moment that touched off his tireless, solo campaign. This humble, accidental activist is a man who cares deeply about the coastline, neatly sorting his finds into orderly buckets, baskets and drawers. Sometimes he'll take select pieces from his collection to create assemblages for friends and post to Instagram. Rather than falling into a trap of despair over the constant flow of new waste washing up, Aaron draws on irony, optimism, creativity and a penchant for finding small treasures (he's particularly fond of the Army Men) to transform a desperate environmental issue into his own personal story of triumph over the day-to-day heaviness of life. Through this process, one of the more wondrous facets of humanity emerges - the ability to transform a desperate environmental problem into a narrative through action, art, and dedication to a cause."

The Anglo-Indian residents of a home for the elderly in Calcutta (1997) celebrate their Christian holiday amidst a fully-realized nation of Hindus and Muslims. They are a living anachronism, foretold by the 17th century East India Company's admonition that its young unmarried English employees seek out Indian women to be their wives, thus solidifying the empire. Cast out for being too Indian, or not Indian enough, their 20th century descendants live out their final days supported by a charity itself descended from colonial times.

But one need not be British to appreciate this film. More than displaced nationality, it is about being old and forgotten in a fast-paced world. And knowing that however discomforting the notion, it is your fellow elderly unwanted who will be your closest compatriots in your waning years."

'Me too', the bully grins. 'You guys were troublesome.'

The HomoFiles (working title) a feature-length documentary, sparked by the research of humanities scholar, Dr. Marie Cartie examines the central role played by lesbian bars in the formation of culture and community and how it served a ""sacred"" function to a population of outcasts, sinners, and criminals. The documentary includes interviews of self-identified gay women, archival photos and footage, and animation to tell their stories. Through their coming out in that period and claiming the bar as public space, we see they were some of the earliest activists in the fight for gay rights, that their contributions are perhaps the most courageous forms of LGBTQ activism, and that their lives that had been marginalized for so long, have a dignity and integrity that deserve honor and a place in the light. And like the disappearance of the lesbian bar in almost all the major cities in the US, these stories are disappearing with a population that is aging out, and it is critical they be documented and shared."

 documentary ," They come in the night, tear families from their sleep, give them just enough time to pack and put them on a plane: this is the role of the so-called 'transportation commandos' comprising police officers and immigration officials. Last year, over 22,000 failed asylum seekers were deported from Germany. The documentary DEPORTATION CLASS presents a comprehensive view of this state enforcement measure for the first time: from detailed planning in the office to night-time operations at asylum seeker accommodation blocks and the arrival of asylum seekers back in their respective homelands - and the question of what awaits them there. Following extensive research, the film crew led by Carsten Rau and Hauke Wendler were present at a collective deportation in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. A project favoured by Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier who was present in person at the deportations. Haunting, moving images unlike anything seen before, repeated week after week as hundreds of asylum seekers are flown out, mostly to the Balkans. Two years ago, Rau and Wendler documented how Germany reacted to these new arrivals in their hit film 'Willkommen auf Deutsch'. With DEPORTATION CLASS, they show where things lead as the mood shifts against the refugees. As more and more countries are declared to be 'safe countries of origin' and basic rights are restricted.

Have we lost sight of the importance of manners? When it comes to politics, it seems America suffers from an integrity deficit. As devoted statesmen have been replaced by career politicians, Americans have lost a sense of trust in their elected officials. Federal prosecution of public corruption has risen 2,400% in the last forty years. How do we the people restore political integrity in America? History credits American youth with remarkable accomplishments and great responsibilities. Even in adolescence, the young Americans of the founding era were scholars, diplomats, even military leaders. Have we failed to recognize the potential in our young people today? Is it time for Americans to raise their expectations for the next generation?"

 documentary ," Sister Corita (1918-1986) was an artist, teacher, philosopher, political activist and possibly one of the most innovative and unusual pop artists of the 1960's. However, what is perhaps even more incredible is the fact that she was a Catholic nun. She was a multi-faceted artist who practiced painting, photography, typography and graphic design, but she became most well known for her colorful serigraphs. In the 1950s, she began teaching art at the Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles and due to her unorthodox teaching methods, quickly gained an impressive roster of supporters. Creative personalities such as Alfred Hitchcock, Charles and Ray Eames, Buckminster Fuller and John Cage all became a part if Corita's network of friends. In the 1960s, Corita began using popular culture as raw material for her work. Her screen-prints often incorporated product brands of American consumerism alongside spiritual texts. Her work also dealt with the horrors of the Vietnam War, and not surprisingly, this subject matter, coupled with her already controversial teaching techniques did not always sit well with the church. Cardinal McIntyre, the head of the local Los Angeles archdiocese accused her of being, ""A guerilla with a paintbrush."" In 1968, partly as the result of this immense pressure, Corita chose to leave the church. She lived the rest of her life as an artist in private practice on the East Coast. Passion For The Possible will be a documentary film celebrating the life, work, and teachings of this spectacular artist. In honor of what would be Sister Corita's 90th birthday (and in conjunction with an upcoming retrospective at Cal State University Northridge), the film will serve as a living, breathing document of the inspiration she spread to so many people throughout her life. Through the use of interviews with those who knew her as well as others who were influenced by her work, we will tell Corita's story in an abstract way. Using archival images from the Corita archive along with footage shot specifically for this film we will create a colorful visual montage. The film will reveal itself as a living, moving, graphic and musical artwork."

 documentary ," In 1928, during a state visit to the small town of ZdÃ¡r nad SÃ¡zavou, in the heart of the Czech-Moriavian Highlands, TomÃ¡s Garrigue Masaryk lifted three-year old Eva Neugebauer up from the crowd. He held up the child, gussied up by her mother in a kroj (the traditional Czech native costume) and bearing a bouquet for the president. Fortunately the attending press photographer, Jano SrÃ¡mek had the presence of mind to take a picture. From this fortuitous moment an iconic image was born, linking Masaryk's enlightened humanism to a nascent Czechoslovak statehood in a symbolic picture of the elder statesman holding aloft the future of his nation. The photo flew around the world as an immensely popular image, just before the Nazi invasion and just after Masaryk's death. It was later transformed by the gifted Czech engraver Bohumil Heinz into a postage stamp. The great Czech writer and Nobel Prize nominee Karel Kapek pushed for the stamp being used as fund-raiser for needy children and the stamp soon became wildly popular not just among Czechs but throughout the philatelic world. During WW II and the Battle of Britain, exiled Czech airmen had the photograph made into posters to remind them of what they were fighting. To this day, Eva NeugebauerovÃ¡ - now Eva Hanka - receives fan mail from collectors of this stamp, many containing requests for autographs. After the fall of the Berlin Wall the stamp was then re-issued in 2000 by the once-again free and democratic Czech Republic, in celebration of those original Masaryk ideals from the founding of the first republic, and the survival through the ruins of WWI and the nearly three hundred years of foreign rule by Austrian monarchs. Eva, the unwitting child-celebrity of Czech democracy, was forced to emigrate in 1950, while the fledgling Czech democracy was once again being violated by global forces beyond its own control. She was a newlywed and fled with her husband Ladislav Hanka through the Sumava hills and across the Bohemian Wood, in a peregrination through displaced persons camps in Bavaria, postwar UN relief agency employment in Frankfurt, by ship from Bremerhafen and through the port of New York onto the corn fields, Czech communities and land grant colleges of Iowa, eventually settling among the Great Lakes in Kalamazoo. There she raised a family with her microbiologist husband and taught school. With this film she is being visited in her retirement by her great-nephew and film director Jan Rousek who answers the question, ""whatever happened to that cute little girl in the stamp"". The film documents a life story which, like the stamp, does not end with a picture, but becomes an epic journey which is itself emblematic of much that took place in the mid-twentieth century and wrote itself into the hearts of the people, affecting the way we live today."

 documentary ," Seydou KonatÃ© is a doctor in Nongon, a small village in Southern Mali, without electricity or telephones, isolated by two rivers with no bridges, and a 10-hour drive on a dirt road from the capital of Bamako. Working out of the Community Health Care Center, with limited staff and technical facilities, he is the only doctor for more than 40,000 inhabitants. EVERYTHING'S FINE portrays KonatÃ©'s everyday routine, meeting with patients in his office, treating a variety of injuries and ailments in the clinic, lecturing people on the use of condoms to prevent AIDS, warning against the dangers of using water from contaminated wells, insisting on regular vaccinations for young children, dealing with complications of pregnancy, and even comparing professional notes with a traditional healer who comes in for a diagnosis. The 37-year-old doctor, who declares that he is proud to be practicing the ""noble art of medicine,"" works at a fixed salary and lives most of the year apart from his family in Bamako.

 documentary ," This American Experience documentary which aired on WGBH, Boston, in 2002, explores the many sides of legendary photographer Ansel Adams. Most associate him with black and white images of Yosemite and other wilderness areas he captured with his large format camera. His passion for nature is well-known.

In typical Ric Burns fashion, we are presented a satisfying overview of this the man who was most influential in making photography into art. This effort is one of the director's most intimate efforts, perhaps because of his love of the subject matter.

The film follows the painful steps of Clair's transition, including electrolysis and the difficult decision to proceed with bottom surgery.

 documentary ," For many years now, traveling to India has been a rite of passage in Israeli life. We hear so much about the Israelis in India that we sometimes forget there are actually Indians living there. Hummus Curry offers an intimate look into the lives of the local Indians living in a small village packed with Israeli tourists. Up in the Himalaya Mountains resides the village of Bhagsu, the rainiest place in all of India. During the hard winter the rain never stops & Bhagsu does not get a whiff of tourism. Kala Kumar (28), feeling bored, spends the slow monsoon days with his family, doing little within the fresh brick walls of his new guesthouse. In April the sun comes out for the first time and Bhagsu is awakened to life. Another season starts and the village is flooded with Israeli backpackers once again. Shoresh Singh (22) buzzes around the many Israelis filling his small shack, serving them the famous Israeli dish - 'Jachnon-Hamin'. Just like the average Israeli, he never stops complaining about his business, speaking in broken Hebrew, quoting lines taken from Israeli cult movies he's never seen. In one of the restaurants we meet Gopal Sharma (29), a charming waiter who gets along easily with the Israeli girls, especially with Shirley, with whom he's flirting at the restaurant's counter. Is there a chance for a love affair between the Hummus and the Curry or will Shirley lose her courage and leave just like the others? Will Shoresh win the battle against the local Jewish missionaries in the war of who will host the greatest Israeli New-Year's dinner? How does the presence of the new houseguests affect Kala & his family, especially the relationship between him and his newly wed wife - a relationship that slowly unfolds during the film? Hummus Curry contains no interviews and the presence of the camera goes unfelt. This viewing experience takes us through intimate, funny and moving scenes that surprise the viewers time and time again. Rain drops turn into tear drops and we are given a unique opportunity to see the Israeli culture, through the eyes of the Indians."
 documentary , London in the 1950's was a cold place in more ways than the obvious. Or so it appeared if you were one of the thousands of newly arrived Jamaicans. Many were overqualified for their menial jobs. Thousands of others quite simply could not get work. Discrimination and racial tensions culminated in fierce riots in both Nottingham and Notting Hill Gate. It was in this environment that the Jamaican soundmen; Duke Vin and Count Suckle arrived in the UK. They both stowed away on a boat from Kingston and brought with them a sound that was sweeping across the small Caribbean island and would later change the face of music in the UK. This was the sound of ska!

Today, this ruggedly beautiful country houses the Nobel Peace Center and stands one of the most eco-friendly countries on earth. How could such a progressive nation spring from such a violent past?

 documentary ," This generation of Americans is taught that our government was established as a secular institution. But the founders believed God was a part of everything, including government. So what are we to make the separation of church and state? How should God and government intersect in today's America? The early American pastor had a reputation as a courageous and fearless leader. In that era, silence was not an option and the word of God was boldly proclaimed as the handbook for life, speaking to everything from morals and values, to public policy and current events. What can we learn from these brave leaders? How can Christians today cultivate a courageous church? Our Founders shared a deep sense of responsibility to care for the poor. But unlike many people today, they believed this duty belonged to churches and individuals, rather than government. Today, many Americans relegate the task of caring for the needy to government programs. So whose job should it be to care for the poor? Who does it better? What is the Biblical approach to public aid?"

 documentary ," ""Bridging the Gap"" is the story of a failing educational system and the life of an extremely unique man named Joseph Dulin, who has devoted his life to successfully educating kids whom under normal circumstances, would have fallen through the cracks of the urban educational system. St Martin DePorres Catholic High School was on the verge of bankruptcy after the Riots in 1967, as Dulin took on the unenviable task of transforming the faltering school into an educational success story by using his unique blend of charisma, discipline and unconditional love for his students, who amazingly achieved a 78% College enrollment in a city where the dropout rate is at 79% (in 2006). Outside of traveling for months as a Special Advisor directly to Al Gore during the 2000 election, Dulin has been featured in Time magazine, on The Phil Donahue and highlighted in countless areas of local a national press documenting his fight to educate, and be educated on equal terms, regardless of race or socioeconomic status. As a young man growing up in Evansville Indiana, Dulin stood up to the racism and the resultant anomie that faced most young Black Americans of the 50's and 60's who lived near that line of demarcation known as the Mason-Dixon. But like a prizefighter that uses his brain instead of his fists, Dulin persevered. Whether it was the inequalities of the school system or the institutional racism of the Catholic Church, Dulin never backed down when it came to fighting for equal rights for African Americans during the Civil Rights Movement and beyond. Before starting Roberto Clemente Student Development Center, Dulin applied his fearlessness and convictions to the Detroit Catholic Educational system by transforming St Martin Deporres into a model for not only all Black Catholic High School's, but all Catholic High Schools, irrespective of race. Directors Gary Bredow and Per Franchell followed Principal Dulin over the course of three school years at Roberto Clemente School in Ann Arbor, where Dulin has been the principal for over 30 years. The result is a gripping exploration of the fine line between success and failure of students who live in a world that is punctuated by economic strife and violence. Dulin and his staff run the school more like a family, and deal with issues one student at a time with great detail and concern. Because of the unique practices that are an everyday occurrence at ""Clemente', they have met the challenge with astounding success, despite the proverbial deck that is stacked against the kids and their families. ""Bridging The Gap"" in an unflinching view of the realities of the American Urban educational experience and one man's diligent and successful response in navigating these students over the widening chasm of failure."

The second trip took place in February 2002 in the city of Herat now freed from the Taliban and in the hunger stricken camp of MASLAKH, one of the largest in the world. The film first relates the journey of Afghans refugees fleeing the bombing and war around Herat and other cities to take refuge in ill-equipped camps. It witnesses the struggle of families having lost everything and attempting to secure a minimal life. Faced with cold, hunger and death, Afghan children still try to learn, play and enjoy whatever life offers them. In the aftermath of the fall of the Talibans, the film explores the city of Herat where it captures the reactions of the city dwellers expressing their memories and their hopes. Forgotten in the nearby camp of MASLAKH (Slaughterhouse) 150,000 displaced Afghans hardly survive. There, hunger, anger and despair prevail. And yet, amid the overwhelming destitution and the daily quest for survival, the desire for joy, beauty and music is still alive. Majid Majidi interviews peasants, soldiers, youngsters, women, elderly and gives a special attention to the children's extraordinary resilience as they are confronted with the emotional and physical turmoil of war. ""Barefoot to Herat"" is a cry for help and an ode to life."

 documentary ," VANISHING CORAL reveals the devastating effects of warming oceans and bleaching events within the ""coral triangle"" of southeast Asia, and powerfully illustrates what some dedicated scientists and environmental activists are doing to save these unique coral populations. VANISHING CORAL comes at a pivotal moment, when coral reef populations are declining world-wide. Mass coral bleaching events due to elevated ocean temperatures occurred in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and coral bleaching is now expected to become an annual occurrence. The environmental costs are staggering: in 2016, one-third of the Great Barrier Reef along the eastern coast of Australia was decimated by a warm spell attributed to climate change. Coral reefs in the Florida Keys have declined by 80% over the past three decades. Scientists warn that all Caribbean coral could disappear in the next 20 years. Considered ""the canary in the coal mine"" of global warming, coral reefs are the most sensitive and diverse of all marine ecosystems. The film follows the work of marine biologist and coral expert Dr. Phil Dustan, who presents powerful insights and direct, visual evidence of the year-by-year dramatic decline in the coral triangle of southeast Asia, changes which are directly tied to the burning of fossil fuels, pollution and other human behaviors. Photographed aboard the 100 year-old sailing vessel ""Mir"", a floating headquarters for a young, international group of environmental activists, VANISHING CORAL presents the insights and research of scientists and naturalists as they work with local Indonesian communities to protect the coral reefs. VANISHING CORAL offers an ecological alarm bell to the world, with specific suggestions on how viewers themselves can get involved and take action. VANISHING CORAL reveals the devastating effects of warming oceans and bleaching events within the ""coral triangle"" of southeast Asia, and powerfully illustrates what some dedicated scientists and environmental activists are doing to save these unique coral populations."
 documentary ," A unique documentary about troops' experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, based on writings by soldiers, Marines, and air men. Some writings were published in the New Yorker in summer 2006. A larger assortment was published as a book by Random House last September. The film drew upon the submissions by soldiers for the book. It's a remarkable portrait of troops at war - the complexities, doubts, and fears - written with honesty. The 81-minute version of the film (which will be in theatres) includes 11 pieces of writing, with different visual strategies, along with interviews with the writers, and with more established American writers who are also veterans. In the latter group are Tim O'Brien, Yusef Komunyakaa, Tobias Wolff, Joe Haldeman, James Salter, Anthony Swofford, Richard Currey, and Paul Fussell. The visual approaches range from poet Brian Turner reading directly to camera, to archival footage, to an animated ""graphic novel,"" to a still photo sequence shot by photographer Antonin Kratochvil. It's rooted in a program by the NEA that created a series of writing workshops at military bases. After those workshops, the writers submitted pieces for consideration in the book, edited by Andy Carroll. From those writings were selected 11 for inclusion in the film. There is also a 53-minute version of this film which will be airing on PBS as part of the series ""America at a Crossroads"" in April, 2007. Both of these are different from the other film 'Operation Homecoming"" from 2007, directed by Lawrence Bridges. That piece was produced by the NEA as a documentary about their writing workshops."

It isn't until Henry starts spending time with Verlin that Verlin seems to become happy and respond to a human around him. However, Minnie wants to believe that response is for her.

Caught in the middle is Ferris, who, like his and Henry's parents, loves and inherently trust him, but who wants to ensure Verlin's safety and happiness and wants to retain a supportive marriage with Minnie."

 drama ," The film is set within a harness racing fraternity and explores the conflict between urban and rural values through the medium of an evolving relationship between father and son. The main character in the film, Hoggy, abandoned his wife and son ten years earlier to establish himself in an alternative lifestyle, living in a caravan and caring for his horses. The world gets turned upside down by the arrival of his teenage son, who has a prison sentence hanging over him. Billy has lived his life on an inner-city housing estate, and in his lifestyle theft and drugs are the norm. Using dramatic seasonal changes within the horse-trainer's environment we follow the development of this fragile relationship. Both father's and son's value systems are tested, with dramatic consequences. The roots of the film lie in the making of Seacoal, which was released in 1985. The film, depicted the lives of seacoalers on the Northumberland coast, and introduced members of Amber to a passion for horses, and the addictive pursuit of harness racing. The Laidler family, who were featured in Seacoal, proved to have a profound impact. It was they who talked us into buying our first horse, taught us the rudiments of training and driving, and encouraged our bartering and re-cycling skills. They wove the web that pulled us into the activity, and secured our entry into their environment and the world of harness racing. Our method of working is based on building long-term relationships within communities. Our aim is to enter into people's lives in a way that provides an authenticity to film-making that goes beyond simple realism. After becoming established in the harness racing community, we introduced actor Brian Hogg into it. His character, Hoggy, was developed over a period during which Brian immersed himself in the lifestyle, contributed to the development of the script, and participated in other essential tasks such as set building and horse training. In contrast, Darren Bell, who played Billy, his son, came directly into his first film role from a background of life on an inner-city housing estate. The film was shot sequentially to facilitate Billy's introduction into an initially alien environment and to reflect on the story of Billy. The film schedule spanned a twelve-month period. We worked with a small crew, two main characters and considerable good will from the harness racing community."

 drama ," ""Glen or Glenda"" tells two stories. One is about Glen, who secretly dresses as a woman but is afraid to tell his fiancÃ©e, Barbara. The other is about Alan, a pseudohermaphrodite who undergoes a painful operation to become a woman. Both stories are told by Dr. Alton, who also delivers an earnest lecture on tolerance and understanding. There is a second narrator, called the Scientist, whose commentary on the action contains more philosophical pronouncements than facts. The movie also has flashbacks-within-flashbacks and a strange dream sequence. We meet Insp. Warren, whose investigation of a transvestite's suicide leads him to learn more about men in women's clothes; Johnny, whose wife left him when she discovered what he wears when she's away; Barbara, oblivious to Glen's desire to wear her angora sweater; Satan, who invades Glen's nightmare; and others. Meanwhile, the Scientist will only offer cryptic advice. ""Beware!"" he warns. ""Beware of the big, green dragon that sits on your doorstep. Beware! Take care! Beware!"" Upon discovering the suicide of a known transvestite, the police inspector seeks enlightenment from a psychiatrist familiar with the phenomenon. The psychiatrist tells him two tales. Glen is to be married to Barbara, but must find a way to tell her of his desire to wear her angora sweater, and of his cross-dressing needs in general. Another is the story of Alan, who decides to physically become a female via surgery (based on the contemporary story of Christine Jorgensen). Throughout the film a scientist inanely babbles about life and death in order to somehow elucidate the story. Cross-dressing B-movie auteur Edward D. Wood Jr. was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world with this purportedly sincere attempt at understanding transvestism rendered unintelligible by Ed Wood's unfathomable script, bizarre pantomime-esque vignettes and a visibly morphine-addled Bela Lugosi shouting about big green dragons."
