# Movie-Classification
CLASSIFICATION OF PUBLIC MOVIE REVIEWS USING KNN.

## INTRODUCTION
The classification of movies into genres is an important task in the film industry. It helps moviegoers find movies that match their preferences, and it helps filmmakers and producers identify trends in the market. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the movie genre classification process. In this paper, we present a movie genre classification model that uses the KNN algorithm and TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction.
